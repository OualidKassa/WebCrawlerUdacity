Written Questions

Q1. Run the web crawler using the configurations located at src/main/config/written_question_1a.json and
    src/main/config/written_question_1b.json. The only difference between these configurations is that one always uses
    the sequential crawler and the other always uses the parallel crawler. Inspect the profile output in
    profileData.txt.

    If you are using a multi-processor computer, you should notice that SequentialWebCrawler#crawl and
    ParallelWebCrawler#crawl took about the same amount of time, but PageParserImpl#parse took much longer when run with
    the ParallelWebCrawler.

    Why did the parser take more time when run with ParallelWebCrawler?


Q2. Your manager ran your crawler on her old personal computer, using the configurations from Q1, and she notices that
    the sequential crawler actually outperforms the parallel crawler. She would like to know why.

    (a) Suggest one reason why the sequential web crawler was able to read more web pages than the parallel crawler.
        (Hint: Try setting "parallelism" to 1 in the JSON configs to simulate your manager's computer.)

    (b) Suggest one scenario in which the parallel web crawler will almost certainly perform better than the sequential
        crawler. Why will it perform better?


Q3. Analyze your method profiler through the lens of Aspect Oriented Programming, by answering the following questions:

    (a) What cross-cutting concern is being addressed by the com.udacity.webcrawler.profiler.Profiler class?

    (b) What are the join points of the Profiler in the web crawler program?


Q4. Identify three (3) different design patterns used in this project, and explain which interfaces, classes, and/or
    libraries use or implement those design patterns.

    For each pattern, name one thing about the pattern that you LIKED, and one thing you DISLIKED. If you did not like
    anything, you can name two things you disliked.


Response :

Q1. ParralellelWebCrawler is more efficient, it visit more urls than sequential

Q2. (a)   If the manager have a computer run with one thread, there will be no benefice
    (b)   With a multi-core computer parallelWebCramler will be more efficient, There will be more work to be done with pool who will split work across processors

Q3. (a)   Profiled measure the time running of methods by annotate @Profiled, it's a cross-cutting concern
    (b)   The methods with the annatation @Profiled

Q4. - Builder Pattern use by CrawlerConfiguration
    - Dependency With Guice library. Use in WebCrawlerMain for Profiler
    - Proxy Pattern use by ProfilerImpl.
